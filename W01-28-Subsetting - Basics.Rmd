# Substting - Basics

## Subsetting

There are a number of operators that can be used to extract subsets of R objects.
* [ always returns an object of the same class as the original; can be used to select more than one element (there is one exception)  
* [[ is used to extract elements of a list or a data frame; it can only be used to extract a single element and the class of the returned object will not necessarily be a list or data frame  
* $ is used to extract elements of a list or data frame by name; semantics are similar to that of [[.  

```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "c", "d", "a")

# Reference to a specific element:
x[1]

x[2]

# Reference to a range of elements:
x[1:4]

# Subset with a logical index:
x[x > "a"]

# Conditional vector:
u <- x > "a"

u

x[u]

```
