## Data Types - Names Attribute

R objects can also have names, which is very useful for writing readable code and self-describing objects.

```{r}

x <- 1:3

names(x) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf")

x

names(x)

```



Lists can also have names.

```{r}

x <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)

x

```

And matrices.

```{r}

m <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

dimnames(m) <- list(c("a", "b"), c("c", "d"))

m

```
