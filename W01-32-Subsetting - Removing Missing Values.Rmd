# Substting - Removing Missing Values

## Removing NA Values

```{r}

# new vector
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, NA, 5)

# Display vector
x

# bad <- logical vector from x
bad <- is.na(x)

# Display bad
bad

!bad

# Elements of x different of NA
x[!bad]

```


```{r}

# Vector x
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, NA, 6)
x

# Vector y
y <- c("a", "b", NA, "d", NA, "f")
y

# complete.cases(x, y) gives us elements that are not NA in both vectors.
good <- complete.cases(x, y)
good

x[good]

y[good]

```

We can remove non complete cases from a data frame
```{r}

# airquality data frame, first 6 rows
airquality[1:6, ]

# set good with comple.cases of ariquality data set
good <- complete.cases(airquality)

# We can now see that all cases are complete
airquality[good, ][1:6, ]
```
