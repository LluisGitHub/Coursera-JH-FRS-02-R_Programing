## Missing Values

Missing values are denoted by NA or NaN for undefined mathematical operations.

nan: Undefined mathematical operation.
na: Anything else

* is.na() is used to test objects if they are NA
* is.nan() is used to test for NaN  
* NA values have a class also, so there are integer NA, character NA, etc.  
* A NaN value is also NA but the converse is not true  

```{r}

x<-c(1,2,NA,10,3)

is.na(x)

is.nan(x)

x<-c(1,2,NaN,NA,4)

is.na(x)

is.nan(x)
```
