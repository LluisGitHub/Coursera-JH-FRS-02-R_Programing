# Substting - Matrices

## Substting a Matrix

Matrices can be subsetted in the usual way with (i,j) type indices.

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)

x

x[1, 2]

x[2, 1]

# Indices can also be missing.

x[1, ]

x[, 2]

```


By default, when a single element of a matrix is retrieved, it is returned as a vector of length 1 rather than a 1 Ã— 1 matrix. This behavior can be turned off by setting drop = FALSE.

```{r}

x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)

x

x[1, 2]

x[1, 2, drop = FALSE]


```


Similarly, subsetting a single column or a single row will give you a vector, not a matrix (by default).

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)

x

x[1, ]

x[1, , drop = FALSE]

```
