# Reading Tabular Data

## Reading Data

There are a few principal functions reading data into R.
* read.table, read.csv, for reading tabular data  
* readLines, for reading lines of a text file  
* source, for reading in R code files (inverse of dump)  
* dget, for reading in R code files (inverse of dput)  
* load, for reading in saved workspaces  
* unserialize, for reading single R objects in binary form  



## Writing Data
There are analogous functions for writing data to files
* write.table · writeLines · dump  
* dput  
* save  
* serialize  


## Reading Data Files with read.table
The read.table function is one of the most commonly used functions for reading data. It has a few important arguments:
* file, the name of a file, or a connection  
* header, logical indicating if the file has a header line  
* sep, a string indicating how the columns are separated  
* colClasses, a character vector indicating the class of each column in the dataset · nrows, the number of rows in the dataset  
* comment.char, a character string indicating the comment character  
* skip, the number of lines to skip from the beginning  
* stringsAsFactors, should character variables be coded as factors?  


## read.table
For small to moderately sized datasets, you can usually call read.table without specifying any other arguments

data <- read.table("foo.txt")

R will automatically
* skip lines that begin with a #  
* figure out how many rows there are (and how much memory needs to be allocated)  
* figure what type of variable is in each column of the table Telling R all these things directly makes R run faster and more efficiently.  


· read.csv is identical to read.table except that the default separator is a comma.


```{r}
