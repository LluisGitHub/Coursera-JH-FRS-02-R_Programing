## Factors
## Factors are used to represent categorical data. Factors can be unordered or ordered. One can think of a factor as an integer vector where each integer has a label.
## · Factors are treated specially by modelling functions like lm() and glm()
##· Using factors with labels is better than using integers because factors are self-describing; having
## a variable that has values “Male” and “Female” is better than a variable that has values 1 and 2.
